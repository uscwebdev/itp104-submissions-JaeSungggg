      <div><p>For this project, I decided to take on a website that displays three of my most esteemed portfolio pieces. I believe having a digital site that displays my portfolio proves useful as it improves accessibility as it eliminates the need for me to carry around a hardcopy. In addition, later on in the future, I will add more of my works including UX design in order to hopefully later use this website for internship and job opportunities. Having a portfolio in my website.</p></div>
